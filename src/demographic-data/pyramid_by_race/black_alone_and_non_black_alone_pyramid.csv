"Notes: Estimates may not sum to totals shown because of rounding. Year of birth refers to events occurring between April 1 and March 31 of the indicated years. For some age-sex-race groups, the estimate for the Low series is higher than the Middle series and the estimate for the High series is lower than the Middle series because adjustments used to develop the range vary across demographic groups.
