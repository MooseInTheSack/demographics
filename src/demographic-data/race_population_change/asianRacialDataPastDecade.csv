"Note: The estimates are based on the 2010 Census and reflect changes to the April 1, 2010 population due to the Count Question Resolution program and geographic program revisions. Median age is calculated based on single year of age. Hispanic origin is considered an ethnicity, not a race. Hispanics may be of any race. Responses of ""Some Other Race"" from the 2010 Census are modified. This results in differences between the population for specific race categories shown for the 2010 Census population in this table versus those in the original 2010 Census data.
